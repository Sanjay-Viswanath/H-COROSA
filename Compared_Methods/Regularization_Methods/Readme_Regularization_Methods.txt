MATLAB codes (utlizing Nvidia CUDA) for regularization methods used in comparisons:

corosa: COROSA method 
tgv2: Total Generalized Variation - Second Order
tv2: Total Variation - Second Order
hs: Hessian-Schatten Norm method (Nuclear norm,p=1)

For help in using these codes, see the files or type "help <function_name>".

Note: These are general codes and can be used for image restoration with other 
datasets. These MATLAB codes require CUDA.
